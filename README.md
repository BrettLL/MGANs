# MGANs
Testing code (torch), pre-trained models and supplementary materials for "Precomputed Real-Time Texture Synthesis with Markovian Generative Adversarial Networks". 

See this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRD8LpPvdHI) for a quick explaination for our method and results. 

To use the pre-trained models, you simply need to call `th demo_MGANs.lua` from a terminal. See the readme file in the same folder for details.

Training code is coming soon.
